## Performance Summary

- **No FL performance data available yet**

This is expected for recently completed experiments. FL performance analysis requires:
1. Server logs to be parsed for accuracy metrics
2. FL results JSON files to be generated
3. Additional post-processing of experiment outputs

## Current Experiment Status

- **Total Experiments Completed**: 152
- **Experiments by Network**:
  - NET0: 91 experiments
  - NET2: 61 experiments
- **Experiments by Security**:
  - SEC0: 49 experiments
  - SEC1: 36 experiments
